# Heart-Disease-Predictor-using-Artificial-Neural-Networks
A model that predicts whether a person has heart disease or not by using ANN.

About the data:
In the dataset, we have 13 columns in which we are given different attributes such as sex, age, cholesterol level, etc. and 
we are given a target column which tells us whether that person has heart disease or not. 

ANN:
Our ANN will predict whether a person has heart disease or not given other attributes of the person.
